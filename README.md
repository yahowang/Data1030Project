Project: Default of Credit Card Clients

Because of the advance of financial crediting system, customers are able to make an expense with their creditability and pay off in the future. Yet, it is challenging yet vital for banks to determine whether their customers would have the ability to pay off their credits to minimize the risk of capital loss. Therefore, one of the ways of doing so is to track historical transactions and payments to target potential customers who will not meet payoff requirements. These customers will be classified and will have a greater change of fedault in the future.

In this project, the dataset was obtained from banks in Taiwan and was meant to target the case of customers default payments. This is a binary classification problem and the target valuable is whether acustomer will default or not based on different features and payment histories. This project is interesting and meaningful because it will help banks to target potential default payments and make a better decision with the customers.
